# Overall Schedule 


<AssessmentDates /> 


The overall goal is to create a student experience application. You should aim to focus on a specific part of the overall experience. You could even focus in on a specific student group (e.g. first years, international students). They key is to solve a few problems really well, as opposed to have a broad sweeping set of features.

The first assessment is about defining the problem space and presenting a hypothesised solution. In other words, you are putting your bias aside, unconscious or otherwise, and determining in what ways students are underserved and devising ways in which a web application could better serve them. To achieve these outcomes you will need to get to the very essence of what students are looking to achieve in their day-to-day lives. 

## Methodological Approach

For your overarching methodology, Dootrix Recommend [Design Thinking](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-thinking). 

You will need to downward scale the methodology appropriately to fit an individual project with minimal stakeholders. 


## Problem Defining

The Dootrix team recommend using either or a combination of Knapp's (2016) ideas presented in the 5-day sprint and [Ulwick's (2016)](./reading/jobs-to-be-done-book.pdf) (JOBS) Job-to-be-Done Job definitions. 


## Solution Testing

At this stage, you will need to engage with your potential audience at least twice, once to determine the problem and again to test your proposed solution. At this stage, we are not thinking about technology or granular implementation. It is about testing a simplistic prototype that has just enough detail to test your validate your ides.

### Ethical Approval

As we are dealing with live participants, you should request ethical approval
