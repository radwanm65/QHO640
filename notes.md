# Session 1 - The latest version of JavaScript

[Good Course](https://github.com/chauff/Web-Teaching#web-lectures)


Throughout this course we are going to be using React as our JavaScript framework of choice. React is very much a light layer of functionality that simply allows to create component based user interfaces. Unlike libraries such as jQuery, and to some extent Vue.js, its purpose is not to abstract away from JavaScript. This is, in my opinion, one of the key advantages of React over comparable libraries.  We can hook into the full power of JavaScript. Furthermore, by learning React, we are also learning the more advanced features of JavaScript. 

The react community has really embraced the the latest version of JavaScript. The purpose of this first session is to ensure that everyone is up to speed with some of common programming techniques used when creating React apps.

1. Client requests permissions from the user. 2. The user is directed to the third-party service that provides those permissions, where the user is authenticated and the request is granted or rejected. 3. The grant is passed back to the requesting client. 4. The client exchanges the grant for an access token. 5. In subsequent calls, the client provides the access token in order to prove that she has permission to access the requested resources. 6. Optionally, the service can implement a token exchange, whereby a client can exchange an expiring token for a fresh token.
