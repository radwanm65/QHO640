Contemporary Web Applications - Week 5 (Introduction)

Hello [:firstname:],

There is no preparation this week; however, this is an important week. 

We are going to be considering the design thinking process we will use for the assessment. 

This will be achieved by trying to solve a real-world problem using design thinking.  

All the best,

Joe
