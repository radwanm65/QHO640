By the end of this week you should be able to address the following questions:

- What is React?
  
- What are React components?

- What are props?

- What is JSX?

- How can we iterate over a list to output components?

- How do you create a compositional component and what is the point?

- How can I apply conditional styling to components?

- In what direction does data flow through a React Application?

In order to do this we are going to start working on our class project - [a goal tracking application](https://www.figma.com/file/rTbqRpRWOw7UYg28SBcxQv/web-dev-pratical-task-made-using-toxin-ui?node-id=31262%3A3)
