Hello All,

Great news! We've covered all of the course content. We've come so far and it's time to focus on the assessment. 

We now only have two weeks left, amd moving forward, we are doing assessment support one-to-one sessions. 

The sessions will be done over teams, and I recommend that you all book a support session.

[Support can be booked on the SOL page](https://learn.solent.ac.uk/mod/scheduler/view.php?id=2248812).

All the best, 

Joe
