This week concludes our React learning! In the following week we are going to be moving on to looking at validation and data persistence using Firebase.

Our weekly learning focus will involve answering the following question:

**How can I gather and validate user data through accessible forms?**

Before the session, along with watching the video above, I also suggest that you do some reading. This will bring you up to speed with some of the important concepts for the week.
