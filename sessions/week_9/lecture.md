# Lecture (Start Here)

This week, we continue our journey into the the wonderful world of serverless. We will be considering how we can use the firebase document database, [firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore).

In doing so, we will be answering the following question?

### How can I persist data in my web applications?

## Solution Video Week 8

If you have not done so already, a recommend that you follow through the solution video for last week's exercises.

Below is a video walking you through the solutions for task 7, 8 and 9 of week 8. Before starting this tutorial, I recommend that you clone the week-8 part solution and use this as your starting point. Simply run the following command:

`git clone -b week-8-part-solution https://github.com/joeappleton18/running-contemp-web-app-solutions.git`

Next, ensure you follow the README.md to connect the project to firebase.
