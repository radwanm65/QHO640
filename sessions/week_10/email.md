Contemporary Web Applications - Week 10 (Introduction)

Hello [:firstname:],

Welcome to Week 10.

This week is going to be the last week of formal delivery. The following two weeks will be assessment support. 

The focus of the week is on the final deployment tweaks for our application. We will be exploring how to secure our database and deploy to firebase hosting. 

All the best, and I look forward to seeing you,

Joe
