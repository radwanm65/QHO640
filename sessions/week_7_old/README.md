# Week 7 - Catch up and Tutorial 


At this point, we have covered all the react fundamentals. Given that this is the case, this week is going to be a catch-up. 

Most of the learning will happen in your own time. Learning anything worthwhile takes a lot of practice - so I hope you have been working hard outside the practical sessions. This week I want us to reflect on what we have learnt so far and make sure that we understand the WHY? behind the following react concepts:

- [JSX](https://web-dev-industry-2020.web.app/sessions/week_2/#jsx)
- [How to pass data into components using props](https://web-dev-industry-2020.web.app/sessions/week_2/#props)
- [Wrapped components](https://web-dev-industry-2020.web.app/sessions/week_2/#wrapping-one-component-into-another)
- [Iterating over data structures to output to the DOM](https://web-dev-industry-2020.web.app/sessions/week_2/#loops)
- [Theming and styling components](https://web-dev-industry-2020.web.app/sessions/week_3/#session-dependencies)
- [State management using hooks](https://web-dev-industry-2020.web.app/sessions/week_4/#state-management)
- [Effect hooks](https://web-dev-industry-2020.web.app/sessions/week_5/#further-react-hooks)

You should ensure that you stop the video and refer to these notes or the react documentation to understand concepts that don't make sense.
