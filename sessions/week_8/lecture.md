This week, for me, is the most exciting session to deliver. I going to be introducing you to the wonderful, time and cost saving world, of serverless systems. In doing so, we are going to be using a authentication service offered by Firebase . This will allow users to sign up and log into our application. Crucially, we will now be able to lock sections of our application down. We'll be answering the following question:

**How can I authenticate my react applications allowing users to sign in using a range of different methods (facebook, email, gmail)?**
