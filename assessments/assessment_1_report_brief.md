## Assessment Task

The practical outcomes for this unit are to create a responsive single page web-application (SPA) that supports Solent University students in some aspect of their day-to-day lives. To this end, over the course of two assessments you will use a data driven approach to identify a specific area in which students are being underserved and implement a prototype SPA to better serve students in your identified problem space.

In using the design thinking (DT) methodology as a lens (see Figure 1), this assessment represents the empathise, define and ideate phases of the overarching DT methodology. In other words, you will identify a problem in students every-day lives (empathise), clearly define this problem (define) and propose a solution (ideate).

## Deliverables

You are required to deliver a **2,500 word** academic styled report which includes a link to your mock-up. The report should include the section presented below.

## Report Structure

## 1. 0 Introduction

This section should provide a background to the problem that you are addressing, the approach you used to explore the problem and your key findings.

## 2. 0 Methods/Methodology

### 2.1 Overarching Methodology

You should provide a summary of the overarching methodology that you are using. I recommend using DT. However, you are free to choose a different methodology if it better meets your needs. You can even cherry-pick elements of multiple methodologies. Regardless of the methodology you use, it must be clear that you have engaged with key sources and taken an organised, systematic approach in following your choice. Further to this, you must clearly argue why the given methodology is suitable for your project.

### 2.2 Methods

You should present the methods that you used. Methods can be considered the tasks, tools and techniques that you used to gain an understanding of the proposed problem and allowed you to hypothesise a solution (e.g. interviews, focus group, surveys or observations). You may use a single method (e.g. interview, focus groups or surveys) or several. Given the scope of the project, I am expecting a sample of around 5 to 10 students for focus groups/interviews, and 20+ for surveys.

## 3.0 Ethics

You should present a brief account of the ethical considerations and acknowledgment that you have gained ethical clearance.

## 4.0 Discussion and Results

This section presents the finding and outcomes of the methodology and methods that you employed. The primary focus will be on the outcomes of user testing.

## 4.1 Prototype

Based off your results, you should to present your prototype and clearly hypothesises how it solves the problem. You should use a tool such as [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to present me with a high-quality design of a single page web application. This solution should be informed by your data collection and analysis and should endeavoured to solve the problem that you identified.

## 5.0 Conclusion

Conclude your overall findings, and propose a clear forward facing path.

## Reference List

A list of sources that you used throughout your report.

## Appendix

Included any additional information, such as mock-ups and ethics forms.

## Assessment Criteria

You will be assessed on your ability to critically explore the needs of your user demographic and propose an innovative solution. Specifically, I will be accessing you on the following areas:

### Learning Outcomes

This assessment will enable students to demonstrate in full or in part the learning
outcomes identified in the Module descriptors.

### Late Submissions

Students are reminded that:

i. If this assessment is submitted late i.e. within 5 working days of the submission deadline, the mark will be capped at 40% if a pass mark is achieved;

ii. If this assessment is submitted <u>later</u> than 5 working days after the submission deadline, the work will be regarded as a non-submission and will be awarded a zero;

iii. If this assessment is being submitted as a referred piece of work then it must be submitted by the deadline date; <u>any</u> Refer assessment submitted late will be regarded as a non-submission and will be awarded a zero.

Extenuating Circumstances

The University’s Extenuating Circumstances procedure is in place if there are genuine circumstances that may prevent a student submitting an assessment. If students are not 'fit to study’, they can either request an extension to the submission deadline of 5 working days or they can request to submit the assessment at the next opportunity (Defer). In both instances students must submit an EC application with relevant evidence. If accepted by the EC Panel there will be no academic penalty for late submission or non-submission dependent on what is requested. Students are reminded that EC covers only short term issues (20 working days) and that if they experience longer term matters that impact on learning then they must contact the Student Hub for advice.

Please find a link to the EC policy below:

https://students.solent.ac.uk/official-documents/quality-management/academic-handbook/2p-extenuating-circumstances.pdf

### Academic Misconduct

Any submission must be students’ own work and, where facts or ideas have been used from other sources, these sources must be appropriately referenced. The University’s Academic Handbook includes the definitions of all practices that will be deemed to constitute academic misconduct. Students should check this link before submitting their work.

Procedures relating to student academic misconduct are given below:

[http://portal.solent.ac.uk/support/official-documents/information-for-students/complaints-conduct/student-academic-misconduct.aspx](http://portal.solent.ac.uk/support/official-documents/information-for-students/complaints-conduct/student-academic-misconduct.aspx)

### Ethics Policy

The work being carried out by students must be in compliance with the Ethics Policy. Where there is an ethical issue, as specified within the Ethics Policy, then students will need an ethics release or an ethical approval prior to the start of the project.

The Ethics Policy is contained within Section 2S of the Academic Handbook:

[http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2s-university-ethics-policy.pdf](http://portal.solent.ac.uk/documents/academic-services/academic-handbook/section-2/2s-university-ethics-policy.pdf)

**Grade marking**

The University uses a letter grade scale for the marking of assessments. Unless students have been specifically informed otherwise their marked assignment will be awarded a letter grade. More detailed information on grade marking and the grade scale can be found on the portal and in the Student Handbook
