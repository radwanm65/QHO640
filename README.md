# Course Overview

Hello, and welcome to Contemporary Web Applications.

This is one of my favourite modules to teach, as I will be introducing you to the cutting edge ideas surrounding modern web development.

I am going to be showing you how we can develop and deploy web applications using contemporary methods.

## Teaching Strategy

- **On-demand lecture**, each week I will be releasing an on-demand lecture. This will be short, and you should aim to watch it before your practical session.
- **2-hour live practical**, you will attend a 2-hour live practical. We will work on creating a modern web application in react.
- **1-hour of guided learning**, these are tasks that you will complete in your own time, after the practical.

## Technologies we will be using:

- **React**: React is currently the most popular JavaScript framework. React developers are in high demand, and contract rates can reach as high as Â£700 per-day! Demand and money aside, React is an incredibly powerful framework and a joy to work with.
- **Firebase**: You will learn how to implement your work on a serverless infrastructure. We will be using the latest cloud database from Google's Firebase cloud platform. You will also learn how to deploy your work on the Firebase serverless infrastructure.

## How you will be assessed

The practical outcomes for this unit are to create a responsive single page web-application (SPA) that supports Solent University students in some aspect of their day-to-day lives. To this end, over the course of two assessments you will use a data driven approach to identify a specific area in which students are being underserved and implement a prototype SPA to better serve students in your identified problem space.

There are two assessments that will allow me to gauge how well you have done.

- **1.Report and Mock Up (due: 4pm, Friday, 12th November )**
- **2.Implementation and a Report (in the form of technical documentation)(due: 4pm, Friday, 14th January)**
